# TO-DO List #

Created this as part of the christening that all new developers go through during their looking for projects phase.

Made the decision to make the UX look more retro to suit it being the old fashioned project that it is. CRUD functionality showcased as follows:

## Switching Projects ##
Users can switch between different projects which are collections of todos.

## Todo manipulation ##
Todos can be created, edited, read and deleted!

## Notes ##
As an added feature, I created a notes page where block notes can be left to show on screen when the notes section is clicked. Essentially a todo entry that doesnt have priority or checking off features.
