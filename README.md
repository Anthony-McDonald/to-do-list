# TO-DO List #

This was created as part of the christening that all new developers go through during their "what can I make?" phase.

Made the decision to use a more retro look for the UX, to suit this being the old fashioned project that it is. CRUD functionality showcased as follows:

## Switching Projects ##
Users can switch between different projects which are collections of to-dos.

## To-do manipulation ##
To-dos can be created, edited, read and deleted!

## Notes ##
As an extra feature, I created a notes page where block notes can be left to show on screen when the notes section is clicked. Essentially, a to-do entry that doesnt have priority or checking off features.
