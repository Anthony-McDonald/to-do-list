make indvidual project pages work as well as the ability to add new ones
    - On this note, as of the moment sidebar items don't get
    removed from localstorage on X click, just from the sidebar.
    Have to sus that out

Grey out projects on click, like elsewhere

Using location.reload() atm to handle the refresh of the sidebar,
that can be improved
