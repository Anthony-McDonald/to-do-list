Grey out projects on click, like elsewhere

Using location.reload() atm to handle the refresh of the sidebar,
that can be improved 

Projects at the list redirect to proj_template now because of lines 461-466. Need to add logic to switch to an individual page,
per one clicked on and the logic to locally store each project list away from each other. Just going to use the proj_templat page and 
edit the tasks that show up on that dependent on which one is registered as being clicked.
